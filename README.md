# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

This repository showcases a comprehensive project focused on sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie review dataset. The goal of the project is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their textual content. The classification model is built using a Naive Bayes algorithm, implemented with the help of the `scikit-learn` library in Python.

## Project Overview

### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the sentiment or emotion behind a piece of text. In this project, we focus on binary sentiment classification, where the text (a movie review) is classified as either expressing a positive or negative sentiment.

### Dataset
We utilize the **IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset**, which contains 50,000 highly polar movie reviews. The dataset is split evenly into 25,000 training and 25,000 test reviews, with a balanced number of positive and negative reviews. This dataset is widely used in NLP research and provides a robust benchmark for sentiment analysis models.

### Model Selection
The Naive Bayes classifier is chosen due to its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness, especially in text classification tasks. It is based on the Bayes theorem and assumes independence between features, which, despite being a strong assumption, often performs well with textual data.

### Key Features

- **Automated Data Handling**: The script includes functionality to automatically download and extract the IMDB dataset, making it easy to get started without manual data preparation.
  
- **Text Preprocessing**: We convert the raw text reviews into a numerical format using the `CountVectorizer`. This method transforms the text data into a sparse matrix of token counts, which serves as input for the machine learning model.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: The Naive Bayes model is trained on the preprocessed data. We split the training data into training and validation sets to monitor the model’s performance and avoid overfitting. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the model's effectiveness.

- **Real-time Sentiment Prediction**: The project includes a function that allows users to input their own movie reviews and receive instant sentiment analysis. This interactive feature demonstrates the model's practical application in real-world scenarios.

- **Example Sentiment Predictions**: The script contains pre-defined example reviews to showcase how the model predicts sentiment, providing a quick demonstration of its capabilities.

## Detailed Walkthrough

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preparation
The dataset is automatically downloaded and extracted from the Stanford AI Lab's official source. The `load_data()` function is designed to read the reviews, label them appropriately (positive or negative), and store them in Python lists. These lists are then converted into pandas DataFrames for ease of manipulation.

### 2. Text Vectorization
Text data cannot be directly fed into machine learning models, so we employ `CountVectorizer` to transform the text into numerical vectors. This method counts the occurrence of each word in the text, creating a representation that the model can process.

### 3. Model Training
The core of this project lies in training a Naive Bayes classifier using the vectorized text data. The model is trained on the training set and validated on a separate validation set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

### 4. Model Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the validation set first, and then on the test set to measure its accuracy and other performance metrics. The use of a classification report provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance across different metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Interactive User Input
One of the highlights of this project is the interactive component, where users can input their own movie reviews. The model processes the input and predicts whether the review is positive or negative, providing immediate feedback.

### 6. Practical Examples
The script includes several example reviews that are processed by the model, allowing users to see the model in action without needing to provide their own input.

## How to Use This Repository

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. The required dependencies can be installed via the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-naive-bayes.git
    cd sentiment-analysis-naive-bayes
    ```

2. **Run the Script**:
    - Open the script in a Python environment such as Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or a local Python IDE.
    - Execute the cells step by step to download the data, train the model, and test its performance.

3. **Test the Model**:
    - Use the built-in examples or provide your own movie reviews to see the model’s predictions in action.

### Output
Upon running the script, you will see the accuracy and classification reports for both the validation and test datasets. Additionally, you will be able to input your own reviews and receive real-time sentiment predictions.

## Future Enhancements

This project provides a strong foundation for further exploration and development:

- **Advanced Models**: Experiment with more sophisticated algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or deep learning models like LSTM networks, to potentially improve accuracy.
  
- **Data Augmentation**: Augment the dataset with additional reviews from different sources to improve model robustness and generalization.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model by fine-tuning its hyperparameters using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search.

- **Deployment**: Deploy the sentiment analysis model as a web service using Flask, FastAPI, or Django. This would allow for easy integration into web applications.

- **Real-time Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback mechanism where users can correct the model's predictions, thereby helping the model learn and improve over time.
